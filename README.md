A digital medial record for refugees.
- When refugees flee their home, they can often carry only the bare essentials. This can mean that medical information is left behind and lost
- When refugees arrive at medical centres, their information is not readily available
- This can provide doctors a quick insight into peopleâ€™s medical past, their current medication, past checkups, how conditions have been developing, etc.
- Medical organisations can use the data stored in the app to identify where resources need to be directed
- Can highlight areas with a very high need for specific resources, or predict where is going to need them in the future
- Can track the progress in solving issues/treating conditions

Potential:
- As more fields are added, doctors can request to to meet with/information from specific patients
- This can allow doctors to monitor, e.g. a pregnancy
- Track chronic conditions remotely and recommend a physical visit where necessary
- Get/send notifications as people arrive at medical centres
